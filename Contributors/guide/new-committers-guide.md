# Guide for new project committers
Here's how to set up the technical and social environment that will support your work as a committer to the StarRocks project. 

## What is a committer?
The plain sense of the word "committer" is that you have access rights to your project's repository so you can read and write the source code. Rather than creating a patch and submitting it to be actively reviewed and then committed, you can now create a local patch and commit it yourself - or even review and commit patches created by others. Your fellow committers will review your patches, usually after you commit them.

## Becoming a committer
We love to see contributors showing commitment. StarRocks projects invite committed participants to become committers and help shape the future of StarRocks project.
StarRocks project's culture is open, inclusive, sharing and always be grateful. Once someone has shown sufficient sustained commitment to StarRocks project by helping out and contributing work to it, we may vote to invite that person to become a committer.

## How does one show commitment?
Get involved and contribute via the user and developer Slack channel, forum ; extend or improve the documentation; work on bugs listed in the issue tracker or submit code patches. Answering other users' questions is a great way to get started.
Note that becoming a committer is not just about submitting some patches; it's also about helping out on the development and user discussion lists, helping with documentation and the issue tracker, and showing long-term interest.

## The Committer's Way
As a committer, you have access to StarRocks project's repository so you can create and edit source code files, not just read them.. Instead of having to create and submit a patch which other committers would have to review and approve, you can now create a local patch and commit it yourself; you can also review and commit patches that other project contributors and committers create. Your patches can still be reviewed by your fellow committers.
Take more care than you may have done before when working on the code, since you can now change things directly, without review. Make sure you understand how your project's committers work and coordinate with each other. Ask your project PMC, or any active committer on the project, for guidance if there are things you are not sure about. In general. the more visible and engaged you are in the project, the more fun you will have and the more access you will have to advice and feedback.

## Committer Responsibilities
Join your project's Slack Channel to keep up with project activity. Answering questions on Slack is also very much appreciated and noticed by your PMC.
Each committer has a responsibility to monitor changes made for potential issues, both coding and legal. If you spot any potential issues in a commit, the right course of action is to post a reply  raising your concerns to the issue list.
Do not be surprised if your first commit has a delayed diff feedback message. It needs to go through the human .

## Attending StarRocks Events
If you don't have one already, make a note in your diary about the next StarRocks Events. This is a great opportunity to meet other StarRocks folks, hack code and learn about great new idea. Watch the lists as the events dates approach for details about special deals for committers and opportunities to speak.
